# Image Classifier Project

This project is an image classification model built using deep learning techniques. It is capable of recognizing different categories of images using a trained neural network.

## Features
- Train a deep learning model to classify images.
- Load and predict image categories using a saved model.
- Command-line interface for easy interaction.
- Uses a pre-trained neural network for transfer learning.
- Supports loading custom datasets.

# Model Details
This project uses transfer learning with a pre-trained convolutional neural network (CNN). The model is fine-tuned on a custom dataset, and the classifier is updated for better performance.

# Transfer Learning
- Uses pre-trained networks like VGG16, ResNet, or AlexNet.

- The model's fully connected layers are modified for classification.

- Training is performed using Adam optimizer and Cross-Entropy loss.

# Data Processing
- Images are resized and normalized.

- Augmentation techniques are applied to improve performance.

- The dataset is split into training, validation, and testing sets.

# Technologies Used
- Python 3.7+

- PyTorch - Deep learning framework

- NumPy - Numerical computations

- Pandas - Data handling

- Matplotlib - Visualization

- Pillow (PIL) - Image processing
